# KubeSpray Jenkins Automation Pipeline

## Requirements

You must copy the public ssh key to the target nodes, it should the key of the user that is running the Jenkins job, for example:

```
cat /var/lib/jenkins/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh <node> "mkdir -p ~/.ssh && cat >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys"

```

Works on RHEL8 distributions.
Jenkins pipeline to automate the installation of Kubernetes on CentOS by using the Kubespray project, the pipeline has 5 Stages

1. Create the inventory file:
   - Takes the passed hostname on the host parameters and fills a pre-built inventory file
2. Create the SSH key pairs, only if they don't exist.
3. Running requirements:
   - SElinux_disable
   - disable_firewalld
   - docker_uninstall
   - k8s_uninstall
   - uninstall_calico
4. Setting KubeSpray Env:
   - Clones the Kubespray project in the Jenking the ${env.WORKSPACE}/roles/tmp/
   - Creates a venv on the ${env.WORKSPACE}/roles/tmp/kubespray/ directory and installs the kubespray requirements
   - Populates the inventory/mycluster/group_vars/all/all.yml with the pass values from the Jenkins user input section
   - Populates the inventory/mycluster/group_vars/k8s_cluster/k8s-cluster.yml with the pass values from the Jenkins user input section
5. Running KubeSpray:
   - This section runs the installation of K8s using KubeSpray, it could take from 7 to 30 mins, this will depend on the connection speed and the number of control plane and worker nodes.

Make sure to distribute the Ansible host public keys to the K8s nodes.

If metrics-server is enabled, once installed you can run the following command to get all the metrics-server options:
sh `docker run --rm k8s.gcr.io/metrics-server/metrics-server:v0.4.2 --help`

```
